**Work in prgress**

A complete and usefull documentation is available
`here <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Protocols>`__

In short: when your are in a local network, you donâ€™t need to use ICE.
But if you want to contact a peer on the other side of the world, you
may have to pass through firewalls and all sort of things. ICE servers
are here to resolve this.
